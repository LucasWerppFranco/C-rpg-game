## Libraries used
I created some libraries with the intention of not only adding to my project but also helping other Gnu/Lunux developers to carry out their projects. Feel free to check them out.

> ⚠️ **Attention:** 1 - I haven't created any installation files yet (partly because the program isn't finished). Feel free to compile and test it as much as you want!

> ⚠️ **Attention:** 2 - This code is initially only working in GNU/Linux environments. I'm not sure if it's working correctly for Windows.
