> ⚠️ **Attention:** 1 - I haven't created any installation files yet (partly because the program isn't finished). Feel free to compile and test it as much as you want!

> ⚠️ **Attention:** 2 - This code is initially only working in GNU/Linux environments. I'm not sure if it's working correctly for Windows.
